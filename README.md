College Club Audition â€“ Coding Tasks

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Welcome to my college club audition! In this repository, you will find The answer to coding tasks. <br>
I have completed The medium level task and is very excited to be a memeber of your club

<h3>Medium Task</h3>
<h4>Real-time Face and eye detection using OpenCV.</h4>
<p>In this task i was supposed to do the following items:<br> 
=> Load the xml files you downloaded<br>
=> Capture video of the user using the webcam.<br>
=> Start detecting frames of the video.<br>
=> Input into classifier.<br>
=> raw rectangle around the detected faces.<br>
=> Show the output.<br><br>

Firstly i downloaded the classifiers and got all the resources & folder linedup, Then i faced the issue of webcam input which was solved by linking my phone's camera and reading image from it's input using a webcam application like: <h4>Droid cam</h4> after that it was all wasy to read the frame, convert them to greyscale for better classification then apply the face and eye classifier, draw rectangles around face and eye also put my name outside one of then in yellow color, and lastly just for convinience i added a fps meter in there

And that was all that took me to create this CV2 project</p>

<h3>What is there in this repo?</h3>
<p><br>
=>In The resources folder you can se the classifers
=>In the Test folder you can see the Live Demonstration of the script
=> Main.py</p>

<h3>Usage and Requirements</h3>

```python
Download requirements using pip:
pip install python-opencv
pip install time
pip install os

usage:
> python main.py
```

<h3>That was all the Tasks i did in the ML section one can open The folder and read the usage of function</h3>
